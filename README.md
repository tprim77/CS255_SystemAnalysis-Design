# CS255_SystemAnalysis-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was DriverPass, a company that wanted to help people get more experience driving to be able to pass their DMV tests more easily. They wanted to design a system that could  schedule appointments to practice driving and give practice tests as well.

What did you do particularly well?

I did a great job at identifying all of the requirements and constraints of the system. I also did a good job of explaining the systems and use cases within.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to revise some of my diagrams to be slightly more specific. There are some situations I did not account for within the design, like how many times the user should be able to attempt login before being locked out.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The DriverPass interview transcript was vital to interpreting the user's needs. It gave a break down of exactly what was needed to make a system that they desired. It also brought up questions about what could and couldn't be done within the first iteration of the program. The user is the primary person we are trying to please with creating the system, so their needs should be prioritized over everything.

 How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 
 
I think the best approach is to take it one step at a time. There are many diagrams and documents that need to be written which can feel like a lot of work at the beginning, but being able to break it all down and explain each piece little by little was important to not get overwhelmed with the different aspects of them system.
